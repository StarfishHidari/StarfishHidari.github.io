# Hosting Considerations

When hosting an event, worlds should be limited to 24 people maximum. It is possible to go higher, but if the show goes longer than 2 hours, it’s very likely you will begin to run into networking issues such as voice dropping, and major desyncing.

  

I’m still not sure why this occurs. One theory I have is the world time losing a point of precision over time, and curiously it seems to lose a point of precision at around 2 hours.

  

In terms of performance considerations, IK calculations are a large network strain on systems at the moment. You can still host events with avatars with IK, but it is one point of performance to consider. Head and hands avatars will be far lighter due to not having to sync IK over the network.

  

# Minimum Specs

I can’t really provide specific spec recommendations, but any server you’re hosting events on should have at least 8GB RAM and a decent internet connection. Because Neos hosting is P2P, it’s very crucial that the host has a decent upload speed in order to avoid desyncing issues.

  

# Headless User Account

Each headless instance you host will need a separate Neos account to host from, you cannot use your existing user account and play Neos at the same time. This also means if you want to host multi-instance events, you will need a separate account for each headless instance running.

# Configuration

The headless config can be found in Config/Config.json in the headless install folder. If one doesn’t exist, you can create a new one using this example config;

  

(this example config was pulled from [https://wiki.neos.com/Headless_Client/Example_Configurations](https://wiki.neos.com/Headless_Client/Example_Configurations) , it is recommended to check the wiki page in case new config values are added in the future)

The first properties you’ll want to set are the login details;
loginCredential

The email of the account hosting the headless instance

loginPassword

The password for the account hosting the headless instance

  

Next we’ll want to set the default startup world. You could just not set up a startup world and instead do this through the command line, but I prefer to set things up through the config in order to prevent me having to re-setup things in the event the headless goes down during a show.

  

This can be done through the
